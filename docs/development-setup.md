# Setting up Libraries.io for Development

## Getting Started

New to Ruby? No worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server, or you can use the included Vagrant setup.

### Installing a Local Server

First things first, you'll need to install Ruby 3.0.5. I recommend using the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv),
and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)

```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 3.0.5
```

Next, you'll need to make sure that you have PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch 2.4 and Redis installed. This can be done easily on OSX using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) or postgres can be installed by using [http://postgresapp.com](http://postgresapp.com). Please also see these [further instructions for installing Postgres via Homebrew](http://www.mikeball.us/blog/setting-up-postgres-with-homebrew/).

```bash
brew install postgresql redis icu4c cmake
```

Since this repo uses an old version of Elasticsearch, it is no longer supported on Homebrew. You can use the ElasticSearch
2.4.5 container from Dockerhub, but the image won't work on Apple M1 chipped machines. You can download the
ElasticSearch 2.4.5 zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-2-4-5, and unpack it
to your local directory.

Remember to start the services!

```bash
brew services start redis
brew services start postgresql
```

If you obtained ElasticSearch from the zip file, go into the local ElasticSearch directory and run `bin/elasticsearch`
to start up ElasticSearch. When developing in the repo and you encounter Faraday timeouts on updates, you may need
to restart your local ElasticSearch cluster.

On Debian-based Linux distributions you can use apt-get to install Postgres:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev libicu-dev
```

If you are using a Docker container for Postgres, you'll need to edit the `config/database.yml`
file with values found from the `docker-compose.yml` file in order for the app to connect to the db container.
Something like this in the default section:
```yaml
  username: <%= ENV["PG_USERNAME"] || "<username from the dockerfile>" %>
  password: <password from the dockerfile>
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
```
When attempting to connect to the database or run a migration and you get authentication errors,
you may need to go inside the container, obtain a psql shell, and manually create the superuser specified in the
config file:
```postgresql
create user <username> with password '<password>' superuser createdb;
```

Now, let's install the gems from the `Gemfile` ("Gems" are synonymous with libraries in other
languages).

```bash
gem install bundler && rbenv rehash
bundle install
```

Once all the gems are installed, we'll need to create the databases and
tables. Rails makes this easy through the use of "Rake" tasks.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
```

Create a [Personal access token on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) (only requires `public_repo` access), then we can download some sample data:

```sh
 bundle exec rails c
 irb> AuthToken.create(token: "<secure github token here>")
 irb> PackageManager::NPM.update "base62" # this is needed to make the API page work
 irb> PackageManager::Rubygems.update "split"
 irb> PackageManager::Bower.update "sbteclipse"
 irb> PackageManager::Maven.update "junit:junit"
 irb> Repository.create_from_host("github", "librariesio/bibliothecary")
```

_(This will not work with the new Fine-granied tokens that GitHub offers)_

You can then index that data into elasticsearch with the following rake task:

```bash
rake search:reindex_everything
```

It is normal to see:

```bash
[!!!] Index does not exist (Elasticsearch::Transport::Transport::Errors::NotFound)
[!!!] Index does not exist (Elasticsearch::Transport::Transport::Errors::NotFound)
[!!!] Index does not exist (Elasticsearch::Transport::Transport::Errors::NotFound)
```

If you are working on anything related to the email-generation code, you can use [MailCatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher).
Since we use Bundler, please read the [following](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler) before using MailCatcher.

You may also need to install the `thin` gem as a prerequisite to installing Mailcatcher:
```ruby
gem install thin -v 1.5.1 -- --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"
gem install mailcatcher
```

Almost there! Now all we have to do is start up the Rails server and point
our browser to <http://localhost:3000>

```bash
bundle exec rails s
```

If you get an error like
```
objc[94869]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
```
you may need to run `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` first.

You're now ready to go with the basic libraries.io app setup, to grab more data check out the extensive list of rake tasks with the following command:

```bash
rake -T
```

## Github authentication and connection

To enable logins, you'll need to register your own OAuth applications on each service to connect your local application. Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket are available to configure. Github public and private project sync also requires an OAuth application each. You only need to set up the integrations you're working on, but you will likely need at least one authentication service.

To enable Github authentication go and register a new [GitHub OAuth Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Your development configuration should look something like this:

<img width="561" alt="screen shot 2016-12-18 at 21 54 35" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/564113/21299762/a7bfaace-c56c-11e6-834c-ff893f79cec3.png">

If you're deploying this to production, just replace `http://localhost:3000` with your application's URL.

Once registered, you'll be given a client ID and a secret key, add them in your `.env` and restart your Rails server.

```bash
# .env

# Github login
GITHUB_KEY=yourclientidhere
GITHUB_SECRET=yourclientsecrethere
# Gitlab login
GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID=yourgitlabappid
GITLAB_SECRET=yourgitlabsecret
# Bitbucket login
BITBUCKET_APPLICATION_ID=yourbitbucketappid
BITBUCKET_SECRET=yourbitbucketsecret
# Github public project sync
GITHUB_PUBLIC_KEY=yourpublicappclientid
GITHUB_PUBLIC_SECRET=yourpublicappsecret
# Github private project sync
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=yourprivateappclientid
GITHUB_PRIVATE_SECRET=yourprivateappsecret
```

## Background workers

Many syncing tasks are added to a sidekiq queue to be ran asynchronously later, including tasks such as syncing repository data, contributors, tags and permissions.

To run these tasks you will need to start a sidekiq worker with the following command:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

Note that if you start the sync before starting sidekiq you will probably need to stop the jobs and delete the queues then restart sidekiq and start the sync again to make it work. It should take seconds to complete.

To monitor sidekiq jobs, and administer them go to [the sidekiq admin screen](http://localhost:3000/sidekiq/).

## Tests

Standard RSpec/Capybara tests are used for testing the application. The tests can be run with `bundle exec rake`.

You can set up the test environment with `bundle exec rake db:test:prepare`, which will create the test DB and populate its schema automatically. You don't need to do this for every test run, but it will let you easily keep up with migrations. If you find a large number of tests are failing you should probably run this.

If you are using the omniauth environment variables
(GITHUB_KEY, GITHUB_SECRET etc)
for **another** project, you will need to either
 * unset them before running your tests or
 * reset the omniauth environment variables after creating a GitHub (omniauth) application for this project

as it will use it to learn more about the developers and for pull requests.

## Re-recording VCR cassettes

Various specs for repository statistics and information use VCR to capture
real network requests for playback. Periodically these cassettes should
be re-recorded to ensure changes to remote APIs are captured, and any fixes
applied to the Libraries codebase.

### Changing VCR's global recording mode

Unless you have all possible access keys set up (GitHub & BitBucket) in the
tests, it's better to individually change specific tests to record new
VCR episodes. Otherwise, you'll be dealing with API errors from the
unauthenticated endpoints.

### GitHub

To re-record VCR cassettes needed for maintenance stats:

* Add `record: :new_episodes` to each specific `VCR.use_cassette` call
* Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token
* Update the `AuthToken` factory's default value to use your personal access token
* Re-run the affected tests, making repairs as necessary
* Remove `record: :new_episodes` from the `VCR.use_cassette` calls and your personal access token from the `AuthToken` factory
* Re-run affected tests
* Find and replace any instances of your personal access token in the recorded VCR cassettes with `TEST_TOKEN`
* Re-run affected tests
