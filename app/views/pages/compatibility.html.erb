    <h3><strong>What About Package Manager X?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Some package managers require compilation before parsing their dependencies, some we simply haven't got around to yet. Luckily Libraries.io is an open source package so if you need to add a new package manager then you can. You can find everything you need to get started in <a href='https://docs.libraries.io' target='_blank'>our documentation</a>.
