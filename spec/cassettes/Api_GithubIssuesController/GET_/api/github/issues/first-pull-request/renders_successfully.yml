        `global` polyfill is broken by ''use strict''","body":"I think I may have
        found an issue caused by how how Webpack polyfills `global`.\r\n\r\n[Here''s
        what happened:](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1916)\r\n\r\n0. Lodash
        uses `global` in its code\r\n1. We introduced Lodash as a dependency into
        Redux\r\n2. I noticed that the UMD build (created with Webpack) is broken
        *if transpiled another time with Babel*\r\n\r\nWe could argue that transpiling
        UMD builds is wasteful but some people do that due to bad configurations,
        and we don''t want to break them.\r\n\r\nSo why is the build broken? This
        happens because Webpack `global` polyfill emits code like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    /*
        WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, (function() { return this; }())))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis
        works as a polyfill in most cases but if you add `''use strict''` at the top
        of the file, it will return `undefined` due to strict semantics. And Babel
        adds `''use strict''`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the `global` polyfill was
        resistant to `''use strict''`. For example, Lodash uses `Function(''return
        this'')` as last resort, which is immune to strict semantics. However this
        may cause issues in restricted environments.\r\n\r\nIn practice, some combination
        of global checks might be helpful. Unfortunately I don''t know enough about
        the ways to fix that, but hope it helps!","github_user_id":810438,"locked":false,"comments_count":1,"closed_at":null,"labels":["bug","easy"],"created_at":"2016-01-31T23:08:20.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T09:28:38.000Z","last_synced_at":"2016-06-28T23:49:52.334Z","pull_request":false,"contributions_count":150,"stars":16695,"language":"JavaScript","license":"MIT"},"sort":[1,16695,1454281700000,150]},{"_index":"github_issues","_type":"github_issue","_id":"9298680","_score":4.2315024E7,"_source":{"id":9298680,"github_repository_id":17350,"github_id":151743427,"number":2920,"state":"open","title":"built-in
